Hey all, thanks for checking out my project! 

This C++ based distortion plugin implmenets 3 clipping DSP algorithms for audio applications. 

As of right now, the plugin is only compatible with MacOS, but a Windows build will be released shortly. (Located in Build.zip)

Feel free to give it a download and try it out on your projects!

Additionally, I've linked a desmos file that models each distortion algorithm on a simple sine wave. See below.

I hope you enjoy.
