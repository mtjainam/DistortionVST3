Hey all, thanks for checking out my project! 

This C++ based distortion plugin implmenets 3 hard and soft clipping DSP algorithms for audio applications. 

Feel free to give it a download and try it out on your projects!

I've linked a desmos file that models each distortion algorithm on a simple sine wave, along with the project source code.

I hope you enjoy.
